Allocations in C threads are now considered allocations by the Python code that launched the thread. This is useful for libraries where the underlying C code can launch short-lived threads to do calculation. Additionally, Fil no longer limits NumPy, Zarr etc. to a single thread, so running under Fil should now be even closer to running normally. Also, `fork()` is no longer done when handling out-of-memory situations, since that lead to deadlocks.
