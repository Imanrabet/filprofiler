Allocations in C threads are now considered allocations by the Python code that launched the thread. This is useful for libraries like NumPy and Zarr, where the underlying C code can launch short-lived threads to do calculation. This replaces the previous mechanism which limited NumPy, Zarr etc. to a single thread, so running under Fil should now be even closer to running normally.
