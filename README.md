# The Fil memory profiler for Python

Your code reads some data, processes it, and uses too much memory.
In order to reduce memory usage, you need to figure out:

1. Where peak memory usage is, also known as the high-water mark.
2. What code was responsible for allocating the memory that was present at that peak moment.

That's exactly what Fil will help you find.
Fil an open source memory profiler designed for data processing applications written in Python, and includes native support for Jupyter.

At the moment it only runs on Linux and macOS, and while it supports threading, it does not yet support multiprocessing or multiple processes in general.

## Using Fil

### What Fil tracks

Fil will track memory allocated by:

* Normal Python code.
* C code using `malloc()`/`calloc()`/`realloc()`/`posix_memalign()`.
* C++ code using `new` (including via `aligned_alloc()`).
* Anonymous `mmap()`s.
* Fortran 90 explicitly allocated memory (tested with gcc's `gfortran`).

Still not supported, but planned:

* `mremap()` (resizing of `mmap()`).
* File-backed `mmap()`.
  The semantics are somewhat different than normal allocations or anonymous `mmap()`, since the OS can swap it in or out from disk transparently, so supporting this will involve a different kind of resource usage and reporting.
* Other forms of shared memory, need to investigate if any of them allow sufficient allocation.
* Anonymous `mmap()`s created via `/dev/zero` (not common, since it's not cross-platform, e.g. macOS doesn't support this).
* `memfd_create()`, a Linux-only mechanism for creating in-memory files.
* Possibly `memalign`, `valloc()`, `pvalloc()`, `reallocarray()`. These are all rarely used, as far as I can tell.
